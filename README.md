- 👋 Hi, I’m @clarote
- 👀 I’m interested in anything STEM but more specifically I love computer science which is why I made a GitHub account.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of a few different coding languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C++, and Python, because I'm trying to learn how to build webpages. I'm also a freshman in highschool on my school's robotics team so I'm learning highschool topics and robotics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything honestly. Any feedback or constructive criticism that anyone has for me is welcome and greatly appreciated!
