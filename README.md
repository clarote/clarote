- 👋 Hi, I’m @clarote
- 👀 I’m interested in anything STEM and hope to major in mechanical engineering when I am older.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a little bit of a few different coding languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C++, and Python. I'm also a junior in highschool on my school's FIRST robotics team so I'm learning Java and Arduino-C, along with some robotics stuff. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything honestly. Any feedback or constructive criticism that anyone has for me is welcome and greatly appreciated!
